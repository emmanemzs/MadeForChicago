# Made for Chicago

A custom city guide website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This front-end project highlights some of my favorite places in Chicago while showcasing my skills in layout design, responsive styling, and basic interactivity.

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

This project was created for a front-end development course focused on clean code and visual hierarchy. I planned the site structure in **Figma** before development to establish a strong layout and clear content flow.

The site is **desktop-only** and features curated sections for:
- Food
- Coffee
- Shopping
- Art

Everything was built from scratch without templates or frameworks.

## üé® Features

- Layout styled with **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**
- Custom design system planned in Figma
- Interactive elements built with **JavaScript**
- Semantic, accessible HTML
- Editorial-style sections with consistent branding and hierarchy
